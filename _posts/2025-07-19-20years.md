## 2005 : a year of change 
Today marks the 20^{th} year i moved to France. 

It feels so far and so close at the same (yes be ready for a *lot* of clich√©s like that). I think that is true of aging in general, as my revolutions around Helios pile up there are more and more moments of such realisation. All the more with the cyclical nature of a teacher's job, counting in school years and generations of kids. 

Still, 20 years is kind of a landmark. Who'd have thought that with the moving around in my life and immigrations and emigrations that *France* would be where i'd end up spendign the bulk of my adult life (and gladly so). 

Nevertheless, when the decision was taken in Feb-2004 to move here with who would - before long - become my ex-wife it was a bold choice. It was bold but needed. I felt in such a rut, and so stuck in place while all those of peers for whom i cared the most were movign on. And then i did somethign i have - sadly - rarely done in my life : i took a risk. Maybe not that big of a risk but to me it certianly was. Moving to anohter continent, to a country where i didnt speak the language, where i didnt know the ways, where i would be utterly dependent on someone else for standing on my own two feet, and aiming for a job that required the mastery of *french* more than any other carrier i could have tried for. 

I think acutally *not* knowing the difficulties ahead and not having the slightest idea of how difficult a lot of what i would be trying was a blessing, that prevented me from blanchign and pulling away before i start. 

## 2006 : a year of growth

I *had* nevertheless underestimated the weight and burden that such a radical change woudl introduce into my life, especially into the that newly-minted marital life. Within one month of spendign every hour in social settings where i understand barely a few words here and there i was frustrated and tired.
